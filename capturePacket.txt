# use tcpdump bash script to detect and capture packets from interfaces

# First you can use tcpdumpt to display available interfaces on your system:
sudo tcpdump -D

# Retreive a dump of packets on your screen:
sudo tcpdump
# stop using CNTRL-C

# Retrive only 5 packets on your screen:
sudo tcpdump -c 5
# see '5 packets captured' screen output

# Display only 5 packets in ASCII format 
sudo tcpdump -A -c 5

# Display 5 packets in ASCII and Hex format
sudo tcpdump -XX -c 5

# Save 5 packets to ~/Downloads
sudo tcpdump -w ~/Downloads/1.pcap -XX -c 5
#You can add pcap file, system will create it and place output

# To read the file you created, go to ~/Downloads and...
sudo tcpdump -r 1.pcap

# Then what I found very interesting was capturing IP addresses:
sudo tcpdump -n -c 5

# And lastly capturing IPs based on TCP port:
sudo tcpdump -n -c 5 tcp
